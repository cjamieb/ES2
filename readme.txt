Walkability vs. Health in Massachusetts by Campbell Braun

My project aims to compare the walkability of towns across Massachusetts with the mental and physical health of the residents there. Does the place we choose to live and the walkability of said place affect our lifespan or overall health?

All of the code for this project is inside FINALPROJECTFORSPRING24.m
Running this program simply runs the whole thing.

EPA_SmartLocationDatabase_V3_Jan_2021_Final.csv = contains all the walkability data, used to run FINALPROJECTFORSPRING24.m

FINALCOORDINATES.xlsx = contains the final coordinates for each data point in the walkability dataset, used to run FINALPROJECTFORSPRING24.m

MAcoordinates.xlsx = contains the coordinates for every town in Massachusetts, used to generate FINALCOORDINATES.xlsx

Alzheimer_s_Disease_and_Healthy_Aging_Data.csv = contains all the health data for this project, used to run FINALPROJECTFORSPRING24.m

(I put all my plots in this zip file as well so you can interact with them by clicking and zooming)
